* I am suffering a lot regarding this feelings on Dabba, I don't want to be like this where I find myself as senseless and not giving my best efforts. I had already spent 1 year of time in doing this I dont want to carry it on anymore. I decided to take stay away from everyone other than my family. Yes in the corner I have this uncertainity if I am doing any injustice but I can't carry it on anymore right, I have already spent an year being this less sensed guy. I want to be a man who can control his emotions and stand strong against any kind of situation. I am working towards it, Yes I have taken all the efforts I can in making sure that Dabba is doing well but it's time I should realize my diminishing focus and concentration levels, I never ever want to be senseless anymore, I love my equations and I draw a lot of satisfaction in unwinding them and making abstract projections invloving other concepts. I am cutting down all of my mobile networks and also gmail accounts by which people can access, anyways I being a very bad stalker which I would like to take out from myself. I can see there are some people who will support like Abhishek Bhowmick, Aditya Agarwal. I don't want to talk to nyone in world I just want to unwind all the statistical threads that constitute the threads of wollen jacket of Machine Learning.

* I want to clean myself from all of my sins and on issues which I am not able to control my thoughts in order to regain control of myself. I want to completely change myself. I should get rid of laziness. I should not think about Dabba and should realize that nothing in this world is permanent. i don't want to use anykind of social media other than twitter even considering the redirects unless it is strictly educational purpose I don't want to use any kind of social media. I don't want use even gmail too. Just before sleep I will check my phone messages before resetting my alarm clock. I don't want to listen to any kind of songs or something. I realized when you start diverting your energy you will get more attached to that subject/object and eventually lose control on yourself. I don't want to let that happen. I want to be able to think wisely in any kind of situation that might arise. I don't want to crave for the results everytime I aim for something and when it doesn;t happen I keep on wasting time rather than positively investigating why I couldn't finish I would inturn stress myself for not completing and increase more pressure on my mind. I don't want to expect anything from this world. I just to break my thinking limits. I know I can do it. I will make a daily routine and try to assess my progress. I am just fed up with this over expectations and also my thought process which is focussing on results rather than the learinng process. I dont want become a bait to the bad side of me. I jsut want to kill bad and the lazy guy within me and start a fresh life.

* Today I was depressed completely due to some personal reasons and was running in loops all day long but was also simultaneously playing Pacogmaes - War of Soldiers it makes me feel relaxed, it is a lighter version of Counter-Strike community game where people create rooms and usually rooms(groups) ranging from 4-12/16 play. I like to snipe and numerous incidents have created an image in mind that I am some what good at aiming things(I can't justify about this in my life here I mean in games). Usually I try to pick the side which has lesser score and try to aim on the high-scorer of the oponent team and I play till the guy quits the game. I might seem like a psychopath haha no its just that I can think parallely in the same rhythm I play. Most of the time I succeed in making the oponent quit the game but sometimes well experienced players show up which doesn't satisy my purpose to release my stress. One among those guys was <span style="color:#0093ff">WILSON</span>. I should say he is the best I have seen in this game and I was hoping probably I would reach his level in some 6 months or so but to my shock I actually did make him quit and I was performing almost like him. I shouldn't say that he got scared but definetely he was shocked because it never happens to him. He was supposed to be "The Toughest" and this just covered up all of my depression. I learned something which I want to remind myself everyday. <span style="color:#0093ff">"Don't just think everything should happen in a single day, things do take time our duty is to just keep fighting. No matter what just keep fighting."</span> To be frank I actually didn't intend to surpass him it just happend. I am sure now I can completely face him with no hesitation. It is such a wonderful learning which made me really happy. <span style="color:#0093ff">Yes winning will make you easily stick to goals but at the same time you should also be able to accept the loss and gather courage to fight again to win.</span> I didn't knew this and was fiddling like a daffar all my life.<span style="color:#0093ff">Accept the loss with smile, enjoy the win gently & remember your duties. Neither win/loss shouldn't define us. We are what we are.</span>

* Initially I used to run inorder to develop my stamina and lose weight so that I won't feel much lazy but later I realized since I am spending an hour daily in this why can't I make this also a part of exploration I want to raise my bar. Previously I used to run about 8-9 rounds slowly I should say it is somewhat like jogging, but recently I want to give my best in everything I do since I am dedicating 1 hour daily why can't I progress in this. I decided to increase my speed and reduce the distance to 5 rounds. I started initially it used to take me like <span style="color:#0093ff">12min:28sec</span> some where around that point slowly in five four days I could pick up my speed to 11min:48sec. Yes it really feels great because you know your pace and I never used to understand why is it so hard to increase ones speed by <span style="color:#0093ff">30s</span> afterall why cant they give their 100% here comes the catch, The essential part of raising your speed is not physical it is in the proportion of 90 mental and 10 physical. <span style="color:#0093ff">Yes you need to focus on the foot steps train to maintain your pace and simultaneously conserve your energy till the end</span> since it is a marathon kind of thing your just can't make a sprint. If you focus on some thoughts during running which I used to do before, I used to run so that I can think quitely and seggregate my thoughts well but later I understood everything is just the same when you try to focus on the physics of running like controlling your pace just like a feedback control system sending realtime signal feedback to your mind and giving back the necessary action in order to maintain the speed constant. Slowly I got the trick of runnig I made it to <span style="color:#0093ff">10min:48sec</span>  I was on cloud8 and I could really sense its all about control just dont give a chance to think about anything else just your goal should keep on projecting every second in your brain. Today is the day literally I was just thinking about 5 rounds & 5 rounds & 5 rounds .. all the time. When I get to think about either Dabba or someone no no my brain just flashes light its 5 rounds you bugger just runnnn. So today I made it to <span style="color:#0093ff">10min:02sec</span>. I just want to reflect the same thing in my work too everything is the same just remember your karma. Evrything else follows. Thank You its a great day overall. Something to laugh I am sensing a growth in height which is really awkward actually at the age of 22.
