* Primary

	1. How does the expression of Maximum Likelihood Estimiator under Gaussian Assumption look like ?
	2. Empirical --> The one that is decided from the data.
	3. Proof of Sparse Inverse Covariance Matrix Estimation's Objetive function.
	4. What is the significance of a low rank matrix ?
		- Computation is one advantage where when we need to compute a matrix multiplication of two low ranked matrices we can take advantage of low rank property of the matrices and also sometimes when the values are almost close to 0 relatively like 0.0000001 then treating it a zero wouldn't affect musch of our calculations.


* Supplementary

	1. [Matrix Completion Problem](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/MatrixCompletion.pdf)
