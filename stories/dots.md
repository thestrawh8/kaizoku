These are the three shades which I have. I would like to balance these states of mine which are different and all together build me up. I will be Aware, Pure, Fresh (Mingyur Rinpoche) & will be contain simultaneously the No fear, No distractions (Tyler Durden) & will also contain the freshness,clarity, excitement, enthusiasm towards learning & mastering science(Richard Feynman).
