## For Dabba 

If you are visiting my site on your own then I just want to let you know that if you are believing in me or having some feeling which you are unable to express due to the fear that I might lose my future if things wont work, then I just want to assure you that if you are believing in me then I will not let you down. because I won't like to let down the people who believe in me. I am sorry if I did something wrong or caused you pain. I wish you will forgive me. If it isn't you. I am not interested in loving anyone else. I don't have much interest in sharing my life with someone because my aim is to standup for the poor kids and the helpless women, I want to make their lives better I want to make education free and women who are forced to become prostitutes I want to free them all everyone has a will to lead a nice life no one on this earth has the right to force someone. I want to fight for them till my last breath.Thanks!
