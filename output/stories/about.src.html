<!-- <p class="card-text" style="font-style:  italic;"><h5>I have been going through emotionally unstable states at this point of my life in which I am fortunate to learn many things. I want to thank God for letting me going through this which is making me stronger. I did lose my balance in life and Yes it does cost time but by sacrificing nothing we cant gain anything. I learned not to expect anything in life. I learned that I would love to be in pain with sense rather than hapiness without sense. I did learn that I am not lucky to be happy but it doesn't make me sad I learned to enjoy the pain. Now I would rather prefer pain over happiness because it gives me a chance to learn and think and discover more about my trueself. I want to lead a life which can bring a smile in one's face. I realized going through struggles will bring the best person out of us. I did see my best and I am taking some affirmations which I will abide by all. I did understand that smile is not a part of my life and I want to enjoy unwinding the equations and will give all I can in process of reaching my goals.I am happy to be a sad guy and Thank you God for this wonderful life!</h5></p> -->
 <p class="card-text" style="font-style:  italic;"><h5>I always struggle in aligning thoughts to get the better complete view which will answer everything. So I was trying to figure out the kind of life I want to lead and principles which I should stick to, Surprisingly everything was converging to single point and I was only able to align to one kind of lifestyle. I could clearly see everytime I admire some character I try to see my reflection in them and which makes me even more clear about my life. Such great convergence I could see in the <sidebar>Shiva, Hanuman, Karna, Luffy</sidebar> all have the same core values.</h5></p>

            <p><h5>I had going through emotionally unstable states at one point of my life in which was fortunate to learn many things. I want to thank God for letting me go through that phase which has made me stronger. I did lose my balance in life and Yes it did cost me time but by sacrificing nothing we cant gain anything. I learned not to expect anything in life. I did put myself into a box of belief and packed it with morals, I lost my sense of thinking by sticking my thoughts to sadness. I don't know why it happened to me but I did get an opportunity to explore the life from the side which I have never been to. It really changed me and has given confidence to stick to some of my traits which I believe were core to my character. Pain is also a good thing as it gives us a chance to learn and think and discover more about ourselves. If you are not talking to yourself then you are not aware of what you are doing. I realized going through struggles will bring the best person out of us. I will take responsibilty of my family and will abide by my duties with absolute presence of mind and enthusiasm. I will endure pain for the good and enrichment of my innerself. I don't want to lose control over my senses and mind and on my work by desiring about the fruits of the events. I will take success and failure as equal and will learn from the experience. I want to make education free and equal to all, Every child has a right to attain knowledge and every human in this world is entitled to receive basic needs of living. Money should not hinder these two, I learnt neither happiness nor sadness are permanent in life. Thank you for this wonderful life!</h5></p>
