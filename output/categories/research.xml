When trying to read the paper I couldn't didn't get the things clearly but it is the same SMPLify concept which has been also taken up in many of Max Plank's design which is palying major role in all of these. They have designed a PCA model of complete bosy and giving the image as an input to the system they try to estimate the pose of the human in the image with a bound which is not explicitly mentioned but we find good results when the image satisfies the condition that the person covers below 500 pixels in the image. So using deeplab model they try to estimate the pose and also the keypoints either 14/91 based on the models you choose. This pose content is then used to estiamte the camera parameters and keypoints to optimize the model based on the keypoints skeleton using the SMPLify and again as usual the same reprojection error minimization concept is used to estimate the model. Thus we finally obtain a model shape which is similar to one's in the image. It has been mentioned in the paper that it almost works in 30fps which is really amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we can see original and the estimated model's image.&lt;/p&gt;

Okay coming to partick's work it based on surrey model (University of Surrey).
It can be said it is most possible simplest pipeline for 2D-3D reconstruction of human face by simplest I mean relatively because it uses a linear techniques in order to estimate. So basically using some landmark detector we try to detect the landmarks where patrick's implementation supports 68 ones I personally prefer the ibug one. Using the landmark file we try to estiamte the camera parameters and try to minimize the error between the 2D landmarks and the projected 3D landmarks usually we come across this technique in Sfm technique and also other 3D reconstruciton pipeline because it is the heart of reconstruction. Using the camera parameters and the surrey's PCA model and the landmark points they to estiamte the shape parameters and project the image onto the 3D face. Patrick is still continuing his work by making the implementaion compatible with Basel Face Model &amp;amp; also trying to optimiza the parameters using Non linear implementations like Cerses Solver.
