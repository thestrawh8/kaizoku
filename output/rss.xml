&lt;p&gt;When trying to read the paper I couldn't didn't get the things clearly but it is the same SMPLify concept which has been also taken up in many of Max Plank's design which is palying major role in all of these.

&lt;p&gt;Review of Journal of Economics Paper by Omer Tamuz's Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief this paper tries to focus on the convergance rate and its dependencies on actions and signals. They try to prove that the convergence occurs quickly with respect signals &lt;em&gt;external observations&lt;/em&gt; rather than actions using a two state stochastic process. Taking the case of Gaussian distribution as the signal distribution they prove that the convergence with respect to actions occurs by \(\sqrt{\log t}\) times faster. They also discuss the definitivity of the convergence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were also emphasizing on the sublinerity of the actions influence. Sublinearity means \(\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{x_n}{n}\).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Economics</category><category>Learning Theory</category><category>mathjax</category><guid>https://thestrawh8.netlify.com/posts/the-speed-of-sequential-asymptotic.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:05:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Twitter Bird using DQN - a review</title><link>https://thestrawh8.netlify.com/posts/twitter-bird-using-dqn-a-review.html</link><dc:creator>thestrawh8</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flappy" height="50%" src="https://thestrawh8.netlify.com/images/flappy.jpg" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://thestrawh8.netlify.com/posts/twitter-bird-using-dqn-a-review.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 18:39:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Deep Learning Setup</title><link>https://thestrawh8.netlify.com/posts/deeplearning_setup.html</link><dc:creator>thestrawh8</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Specifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS - Ubuntu 16.04&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics - Nvidia Optimus (GTX1070 + IntelHD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After fresh installation of Ubuntu 16.04 "Disabling nouveau driver"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;

So if you too built a your new PC like me then it might be helpful to you for temporary replacement. Uninstall your alsa-base and reinstall latest version it will work fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt-get remove alsa-base
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now go to http://www.stchman.com/tools/alsa/alsa_setup.sh and download the script and then do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo ./alsa_setup.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will reinstall the lastest driver in your system and reboots it.
 Precautions if you are having Hybrid Graphics(Intel + Nvidia) then it is suggested to run on Intel HD Graphics and then install. Because this driver is supported for Intel HDA versions if you try to install when you are running in NVIDIA this might cause several failures.
