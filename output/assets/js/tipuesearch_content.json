Press 'CTRL+Alt+F1' you will enter shell now enter your username and password credentials and then continue\nsudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n\n\nNow add the following lines in the end of the file ( Save & Exit)\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\noptions nouveau modeset=0\nalias nouveau off\nalias lbm-nouveau off\n\n\n\nNow get back to terminal and enter the following and later update the kernel and reboot\necho options nouveau modeset=0 | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau-kms.conf\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nsudo reboot\n\n\n\nIntel+Nvidia GPU working setup using bumblebee and primus\nBasically using primus we can switch between the graphics and we take the help of bumblebee to make it smooth and we also take the help of a GUI indicator to make the transistions more simple.\nAdd the following repositories\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:graphics-drivers\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:bumblebee/testing\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n\nGo to Settings >> Software & Updates >> Additional Drivers\nSelect Nvidia-378 driver (because it is stable and it worked for me) and click on Apply and then Restart the system.\nAfter Restarting you can see the Nvidia-driver being selected as the display driver which previously was Xorg's nouveau.For further conforamtion you can check with the following command and the output will be comething like this.\nnvidia-smi\n\n[root@localhost release]# nvidia-smi\nWed Sep 26 23:16:16 2012       \n+------------------------------------------------------+                       \n| NVIDIA-SMI 3.295.41   Driver Version: 295.41         |                       \n|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| Nb.

In my case I have downloaded cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run file because previous ones need a below 4.9 gcc compiler but when it comes to 16.04 by defualt it installs gcc-5.0 and the installation of Caffe requires a gcc-5 compiler to work ( portbuf). After downloading go to the specific folder and then\nchmod 755 cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run\nsudo ./cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run\n\n\n\nEnter no when asked to install Nvidia driver and rest all can be entered as Yes.\nDon't worry if it shows something like this\n===========\n\n= Summary =\n\n===========\n\nDriver: Not Selected\n\nToolkit: Installed in /usr/local/cuda-8.0\n\nSamples: Installed in /home/username, but missing recommended libraries\n\nPlease make sure that\n\n- PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin\n\n- LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64, or, add /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64 to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig as root\n\nTo uninstall the CUDA Toolkit, run the uninstall script in /usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin\n\nPlease see CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf in /usr/local/cuda-8.0/doc/pdf for detailed information on setting up CUDA.\n\n***WARNING: Incomplete installation!
