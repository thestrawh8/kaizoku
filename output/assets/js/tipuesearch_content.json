      "text": "In this I would like to share the working of UP. When trying to read the paper I couldn't didn't get the things clearly but it is the same SMPLify concept which has been also taken up in many of Max Plank's design which is palying major role in all of these. They have designed a PCA model of complete bosy and giving the image as an input to the system they try to estimate the pose of the human in the image with a bound which is not explicitly mentioned but we find good results when the image satisfies the condition that the person covers below 500 pixels in the image. So using deeplab model they try to estimate the pose and also the keypoints either 14/91 based on the models you choose. This pose content is then used to estiamte the camera parameters and keypoints to optimize the model based on the keypoints skeleton using the SMPLify and again as usual the same reprojection error minimization concept is used to estimate the model. Thus we finally obtain a model shape which is similar to one's in the image. It has been mentioned in the paper that it almost works in 30fps which is really amazing.\nBelow we can see original and the estimated model's image.",

      "text": "Patrick's model is the only to truluy mention which has made the complete end to end process pipeline as opensource since this reconstruction of human faces has some market value as it has a capability to attract a good amount of people that might be the reason for less exposure of the code. Okay coming to partick's work it based on surrey model (University of Surrey).\nIt can be said it is most possible simplest pipeline for 2D-3D reconstruction of human face by simplest I mean relatively because it uses a linear techniques in order to estimate. So basically using some landmark detector we try to detect the landmarks where patrick's implementation supports 68 ones I personally prefer the ibug one. Using the landmark file we try to estiamte the camera parameters and try to minimize the error between the 2D landmarks and the projected 3D landmarks usually we come across this technique in Sfm technique and also other 3D reconstruciton pipeline because it is the heart of reconstruction. Using the camera parameters and the surrey's PCA model and the landmark points they to estiamte the shape parameters and project the image onto the 3D face. Patrick is still continuing his work by making the implementaion compatible with Basel Face Model & also trying to optimiza the parameters using Non linear implementations like Cerses Solver.\n\nThe sample output will look like this",

      "text": "Recently a lot research has been taking place in the region of combination of Computer Graphics & Computer Vision areas and the standards are being expected to raise after apple's introduction of Iphone X which have cutdown a lot of efforts in coverting the 2D-3D mapping using its front camera which seems to project a huge number of IR rays to estimate the geometry of the human face but it is really hard for a normal person to afford such high costs so I myself being an Indian and want to make it available to the normal families to experience such high end technolgies which would build more passion towards learning have taken up this project as one of my most import project and am planning to work in parallel along with mathematical visualization of Machine Learning and its advancements. \n\n\n\nI would like to keep this as a log which will help me remember the flow of work which I have planned to implement this work. It has really taken a lot of time since I am all by myself if having any advisor would have made work a bit more easier since with their experience I probably would have been directed to this point, Since I first became aware of this 3D Face Reconstruction technology based on the works of Prof.Ira Kemelmacher - UW CSE, I was first trying to understand the Shape from Shading, Structure from Motion techniques since I being from an EE background never had a chance to take up an Computer Graphics course even though I had taken up Computer Vision course in my final semester I wasn't much interested at that point of time since my drive was always towards the mathematical concepts that have been entangled either be it Machine Learning / Computer Vision / Medical Imaging or anything i was just addicted to the understanding of concepts on my own since I felt I would lose the kick/joy which I would gain during learning it after reading pages after pages sadly I was into that buble I kept reading papers after papers even till today I am doing the same but I realisez it is the time to take some action instead of aiming for one big ball, I should first pick up the lego pieces and try to join once after the other. Sorry I have gone completely out of the topic coming back, Every time I try to think about this problem how to make the 2D-3D interaction in a way with lesser complexity and higher accessibility always diffrent combinations of pipelines pop up in my mind instead I have decided I should implement one at first then it would make me clear during the implementation process how to permute the blocks in the pipeleine.",

      "text": "Review of Journal of Economics Paper by Omer Tamuz's Group\n\nIn brief this paper tries to focus on the convergance rate and its dependencies on actions and signals. They try to prove that the convergence occurs quickly with respect signals external observations rather than actions using a two state stochastic process. Taking the case of Gaussian distribution as the signal distribution they prove that the convergence with respect to actions occurs by \\(\\sqrt{\\log t}\\) times faster. They also discuss the definitivity of the convergence. \nThey were also emphasizing on the sublinerity of the actions influence. Sublinearity means \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{x_n}{n}\\).",

      "text": "2018 March 01\n\n\nInitially I used to run inorder to develop my stamina and lose weight so that I won't feel much lazy but later I realized since I am spending an hour daily in this why can't I make this also a part of exploration I want to raise my bar. Previously I used to run about 8-9 rounds slowly I should say it is somewhat like jogging, but recently I want to give my best in everything I do since I am dedicating 1 hour daily why can't I progress in this. I decided to increase my speed and reduce the distance to 5 rounds. I started initially it used to take me like 12min:28sec some where around that point slowly in five four days I could pick up my speed to 11min:48sec. Yes it really feels great because you know your pace and I never used to understand why is it so hard to increase ones speed by 30s afterall why cant they give their 100% here comes the catch, The essential part of raising your speed is not physical it is in the proportion of 90 mental and 10 physical. Yes you need to focus on the foot steps train to maintain your pace and simultaneously conserve your energy till the end since it is a marathon kind of thing your just can't make a sprint. If you focus on some thoughts during running which I used to do before and that was actually why I used to run so that I can think quite well but later I understood everything is just the same when you try to focus on the physics of running like controlling your pace just like a feedback control system sending realtime signal feedback to your mind and giving back the necessary action in order to maintain the speed constant. Slowly I got the trick of runnig I made it to 10min:48sec I was on cloud8 and I could really sense its all about control just dont give a chance to think about anything else just your goal should keep on projecting every second in your brain. Today is the day literally I was just thinking about 5 rounds & 5 rounds & 5 rounds .. all the time. When I get to think about either Dabba or someone no no my brain just flashes light its 5 rounds you bugger just runnnn. So today I made it to 10min:02sec. I just want to reflect the same thing in my work too everything is the same just remember your karma. Evrything else follows. Thank You its a great day overall. Something to laugh I am sensing a growth in height which is really awkward actually at the age of 22.",
