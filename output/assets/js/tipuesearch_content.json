The regular approach would be remove single point from the graph and check if the remainig graph is connected or not by DFS/BFS. This would result in complexity of O(n(n+m)) to find all the articulated points. Instead in order to find the points in O(n+m) we use the following algorithm. Simply saying when there are not back edges all the inner points are articulated points. If there is a back edge connecting to its ancestors which is not its parent then it usually results in a cycle mostly where the points in between the ancestor and out vertex would not result in disconnectivity of graph since having an alternate back path which would connect remaining vertices.\n\n\nConditions of an articualtion point:\n\nIf the point is root and has more than one child.\nIf the children's discovery time is not less than the discovery time of parent. Then parent is an articulation point.\n\nExample Problem - SUBMERGE\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass Graph{\nprivate:\n    int V,time;\n    vector<int> articulation_points;\n    int *parent,*lowest_ancestor,*discovered_time;\n    bool *visited,done,*articulation_point;\n    vector<int> *adjacency_list;\n\n    void articulation_checker(int u){\n        visited[u] = true;\n        int num_child=0;\n        discovered_time[u] = lowest_ancestor[u] = ++time;\n        for(vector<int>::iterator i = adjacency_list[u].begin();i != adjacency_list[u].end();i++){\n            if(!visited[*i]){\n                num_child++;\n                parent[*i] = u;\n                articulation_checker(*i);\n                lowest_ancestor[u] = min(lowest_ancestor[u],lowest_ancestor[*i]);\n\n                if(parent[u]==-1 && num_child>1){\n                    articulation_point[u] = true;\n                }\n                else if( parent[u]!= -1 && lowest_ancestor[*i] >= discovered_time[u]){\n                    articulation_point[u] = true;\n                }\n            }\n            else if(*i != parent[u])\n                lowest_ancestor[u] = min(lowest_ancestor[u],discovered_time[*i]);\n        }\n}\n\npublic:\n    Graph(int V){\n        this->V = V;\n        time = 0;\n        done = false;\n        adjacency_list = new vector<int>[V];\n        parent = new int[V];\n        lowest_ancestor = new int[V];\n        discovered_time = new int[V];\n        visited = new bool[V];\n        articulation_point = new bool[V];\n\n\n        memset(parent,-1, V*sizeof(int));\n        memset(visited,false,V*sizeof(bool));\n        memset(articulation_point, false, V * sizeof(bool));\n    }\n    ~Graph(){\n        delete [] adjacency_list;\n        delete [] discovered_time;\n        delete [] parent;\n        delete [] lowest_ancestor;\n        delete [] articulation_point;\n        delete [] visited;\n    }\n\n    bool addedge(int u,int v){\n    u = u-1;\n    v = v-1;\n    if (u < 0 || u >= V) return false;\n    if (v < 0 || v >= V) return false;\n    adjacency_list[u].push_back(v);\n    adjacency_list[v].push_back(u);\n    return true;\n}\n\n    void dfs(){\n    for(int i=0;i<V;i++){\n        if(!visited[i])\n            articulation_checker(i);\n    }\n}\n\n    vector<int> getarticulation_points(){\n        if(done)\n            return articulation_points;\n        dfs();\n        done = true;\n        for (int u = 0; u < V; u++)\n            if (articulation_point[u])\n                articulation_points.push_back(u);\n        return articulation_points;\n}\n\n};\n\nint main(){\n    int num_vert,num_edg,vert1,vert2;\n    while(1){\n        cin >> num_vert >> num_edg;\n        if(num_vert !=0 && num_edg !=0){\n            Graph G(num_vert);\n            for(int i=0;i<num_edg;i++){\n                cin >> vert1 >> vert2;\n                G.addedge(vert1,vert2);\n            }\n        cout << G.getarticulation_points().size() << \"\\n\";\n        }\n        else\n            break;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\n\n\n2018 March 22\n\n\nGiven a DAG try to find all the paths through which we can reach the destination from source.\nSolve SUBMERGE problem in SPOJ.\n\n\nOlder Programs\n\nMerge Two Binary Trees\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    TreeNode* mergeTrees(TreeNode *t1,TreeNode *t2) {\n\n        if(t1==NULL && t2==NULL){\n            return NULL;\n        }\n        else{\n            if(t1==NULL){\n                t1 = t2;\n            }\n            else if(t1 !=NULL && t2 !=NULL){\n                t1->val = t1->val + t2->val;\n                t1->left = mergeTrees(t1->left,t2->left);\n                t1->right = mergeTrees(t1->right,t2->right);\n            }\n            return t1;\n            }\n        }\n\n};\n\n\n\nReverse words in a String\nLearned about input stringstream have to check soem more regarding stringstream operation.\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    string reverseWords(string s) {\n        std::istringstream tmp(s);\n        std::stringstream ss;\n        std::vector<std::string> collection((std::istream_iterator<std::string>(tmp)),std::istream_iterator<std::string>());\n        for (std::vector<std::string>::iterator it=collection.begin();it!=collection.end();it++){\n            std::reverse((*it).begin(),(*it).end());\n            ss << *it << \" \";  \n        }\n    std::string result = ss.str();\n    result.pop_back();\n    return result;\n    }\n};\n\n\n\nEncode and Decode TinyURL\nLearned about find operation in unordered::map container it returns an const_iterator which points to the given key.

      "text": "In this I would like to share the working of UP.\nWhen trying to read the paper I couldn't didn't get the things clearly but it is the same SMPLify concept which has been also taken up in many of Max Plank's design which is palying major role in all of these.\n \n\n They have designed a PCA model of complete bosy and giving the image as an input to the system they try to estimate the pose of the human in the image with a bound which is not explicitly mentioned but we find good results when the image satisfies the condition that the person covers below 500 pixels in the image. So using deeplab model they try to estimate the pose and also the keypoints either 14/91 based on the models you choose. This pose content is then used to estiamte the camera parameters and keypoints to optimize the model based on the keypoints skeleton using the SMPLify and again as usual the same reprojection error minimization concept is used to estimate the model. Thus we finally obtain a model shape which is similar to one's in the image. It has been mentioned in the paper that it almost works in 30fps which is really amazing.\nBelow we can see original and the estimated model's image.",

Okay coming to partick's work it based on surrey model (University of Surrey).\n\nIt can be said it is most possible simplest pipeline for 2D-3D reconstruction of human face by simplest I mean relatively because it uses a linear techniques in order to estimate. So basically using some landmark detector we try to detect the landmarks where patrick's implementation supports 68 ones I personally prefer the ibug one. Using the landmark file we try to estiamte the camera parameters and try to minimize the error between the 2D landmarks and the projected 3D landmarks usually we come across this technique in Sfm technique and also other 3D reconstruciton pipeline because it is the heart of reconstruction. Using the camera parameters and the surrey's PCA model and the landmark points they to estiamte the shape parameters and project the image onto the 3D face. Patrick is still continuing his work by making the implementaion compatible with Basel Face Model & also trying to optimiza the parameters using Non linear implementations like Cerses Solver.\nThe sample output will look like this",

It has really taken a lot of time since I am all by myself if having any advisor would have made work a bit more easier since with their experience I probably would have been directed to this point, Since I first became aware of this 3D Face Reconstruction technology based on the works of Prof.Ira Kemelmacher - UW CSE, I was first trying to understand the Shape from Shading, Structure from Motion techniques since I being from an EE background never had a chance to take up an Computer Graphics course even though I had taken up Computer Vision course in my final semester I wasn't much interested at that point of time since my drive was always towards the mathematical concepts that have been entangled either be it Machine Learning / Computer Vision / Medical Imaging or anything i was just addicted to the understanding of concepts on my own since I felt I would lose the kick/joy which I would gain during learning it after reading pages after pages sadly I was into that buble I kept reading papers after papers even till today I am doing the same but I realisez it is the time to take some action instead of aiming for one big ball, I should first pick up the lego pieces and try to join once after the other. Sorry I have gone completely out of the topic coming back, Every time I try to think about this problem how to make the 2D-3D interaction in a way with lesser complexity and higher accessibility always diffrent combinations of pipelines pop up in my mind instead I have decided I should implement one at first then it would make me clear during the implementation process how to permute the blocks in the pipeleine.",

In my case I have downloaded cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run file because previous ones need a below 4.9 gcc compiler but when it comes to 16.04 by defualt it installs gcc-5.0 and the installation of Caffe requires a gcc-5 compiler to work ( portbuf). After downloading go to the specific folder and then\nchmod 755 cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run\nsudo ./cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run\n\n\n\nEnter no when asked to install Nvidia driver and rest all can be entered as Yes.\nDon't worry if it shows something like this\n===========\n\n= Summary =\n\n===========\n\nDriver: Not Selected\n\nToolkit: Installed in /usr/local/cuda-8.0\n\nSamples: Installed in /home/username, but missing recommended libraries\n\nPlease make sure that\n\n- PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin\n\n- LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64, or, add /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64 to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig as root\n\nTo uninstall the CUDA Toolkit, run the uninstall script in /usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin\n\nPlease see CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf in /usr/local/cuda-8.0/doc/pdf for detailed information on setting up CUDA.\n\n***WARNING: Incomplete installation! This installation did not install the CUDA Driver. A driver of version at least 361.00 is required for CUDA 8.0 functionality to work.\n\n\n\nNow (Optional not required)\nsudo modprobe nvidia\n\n\n\nsudo vim /etc/profile\n\nand enter in the end\n\nexport PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin:$PATH  \nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\n\n\nNow save & exit\nsudo ldconfig\n\n\n\nThe setup is complete for CUDA now it's time to verify this\nsudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev  libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx  \n\n\n\nNow go to the location where samples folder is installed by default it is installed at ~/\ncd into the samples directory\ncd 1_Utilities/deviceQuery\nsudo make\nsudo ./deviceQuery\n\n\n\nit should show something like this\nDevice 0: Quadro M1000M\n  CUDA Driver Version / Runtime Version          8.0 / 7.5\n  CUDA Capability Major/Minor version number:    5.0\n  Total amount of global memory:                 2002 MBytes (2099642368 bytes)\n  ( 4) Multiprocessors, (128) CUDA Cores/MP:     512 CUDA Cores\n  GPU Max Clock rate:                            1072 MHz (1.07 GHz)\n  Memory Clock rate:                             2505 Mhz\n  Memory Bus Width:                              128-bit\n  L2 Cache Size:                                 2097152 bytes\n  Maximum Texture Dimension Size (x,y,z)         1D=(65536), 2D=(65536, 65536), 3D=(4096, 4096, 4096)\n  Maximum Layered 1D Texture Size, (num) layers  1D=(16384), 2048 layers\n  Maximum Layered 2D Texture Size, (num) layers  2D=(16384, 16384), 2048 layers\n  Total amount of constant memory:               65536 bytes\n  Total amount of shared memory per block:       49152 bytes\n  Total number of registers available per block: 65536\n  Warp size:                                     32\n  Maximum number of threads per multiprocessor:  2048\n  Maximum number of threads per block:           1024\n  Max dimension size of a thread block (x,y,z): (1024, 1024, 64)\n  Max dimension size of a grid size    (x,y,z): (2147483647, 65535, 65535)\n  Maximum memory pitch:                          2147483647 bytes\n  Texture alignment:                             512 bytes\n  Concurrent copy and kernel execution:          Yes with 1 copy engine(s)\n  Run time limit on kernels:                     No\n  Integrated GPU sharing Host Memory:            No\n  Support host page-locked memory mapping:       Yes\n  Alignment requirement for Surfaces:            Yes\n  Device has ECC support:                        Disabled\n  Device supports Unified Addressing (UVA):      Yes\n  Device PCI Domain ID / Bus ID / location ID:   0 / 1 / 0\n  Compute Mode:\n     < Default (multiple host threads can use with device simultaneously) >\n\ndeviceQuery, CUDA Driver = CUDART, CUDA Driver Version = 8.0, CUDA Runtime Version = 7.5, NumDevs = 1, Device0 = Quadro M1000M\nResult = PASS\n\n\n\nSimilarly we conduct the bandwidth test which will also show PASS something similar to above  and then we confirm its installation. If it shows fail then there is some error in CUDA installation.\ncd ..\ncd bandwidthTest\nsudo make\nsudo ./bandwidthTest\n\n\n\nWith this we are ready with our system to use CUDA and NVIDIA GPU.\n\nInstallation of CUDNN (Easiest of All I should say)\n\nGo to Nvidia's site and download cuDNN ( I myself used cuDNN 5.1) you will get almost 98MB file now extract the contents and go to the extracted folder\ncd /cuda\nsudo cp -P include/cudnn.h /usr/include\nsudo cp -P lib64/libcudnn* /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/\nsudo chmod a+r /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn*\n\n\n\n\nInstalling OpenCV3.2 (may not be complete but is enough for working with caffe)\n\nIn Ubuntu 16.04, install the dependencies first and then build the OpenCV 3.2 from source.\nsudo apt-get install --assume-yes build-essential cmake git\nsudo apt-get install --assume-yes pkg-config unzip ffmpeg qtbase5-dev python-dev python3-dev python-numpy python3-numpy\nsudo apt-get install --assume-yes libopencv-dev libgtk-3-dev libdc1394-22 libdc1394-22-dev libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev\nsudo apt-get install --assume-yes libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libxine2-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev\nsudo apt-get install --assume-yes libv4l-dev libtbb-dev libfaac-dev libmp3lame-dev libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev libtheora-dev\nsudo apt-get install --assume-yes libvorbis-dev libxvidcore-dev v4l-utils python-vtk\nsudo apt-get install --assume-yes liblapacke-dev libopenblas-dev checkinstall\nsudo apt-get install --assume-yes libgdal-dev\n\n\n\nDownload the latest source archive for OpenCV 3.2 from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/3.2.0.zip\nEnter the unpacked directory.
