      "text": "In this I would like to share the working of UP.\nWhen trying to read the paper I couldn't didn't get the things clearly but it is the same SMPLify concept which has been also taken up in many of Max Plank's design which is palying major role in all of these.\n \n\n They have designed a PCA model of complete bosy and giving the image as an input to the system they try to estimate the pose of the human in the image with a bound which is not explicitly mentioned but we find good results when the image satisfies the condition that the person covers below 500 pixels in the image. So using deeplab model they try to estimate the pose and also the keypoints either 14/91 based on the models you choose. This pose content is then used to estiamte the camera parameters and keypoints to optimize the model based on the keypoints skeleton using the SMPLify and again as usual the same reprojection error minimization concept is used to estimate the model. Thus we finally obtain a model shape which is similar to one's in the image. It has been mentioned in the paper that it almost works in 30fps which is really amazing.\nBelow we can see original and the estimated model's image.",

      "text": "Patrick's model is the only to truluy mention which has made the complete end to end process pipeline as opensource since this reconstruction of human faces has some market value as it has a capability to attract a good amount of people that might be the reason for less exposure of the code. Okay coming to partick's work it based on surrey model (University of Surrey).\n\nIt can be said it is most possible simplest pipeline for 2D-3D reconstruction of human face by simplest I mean relatively because it uses a linear techniques in order to estimate. So basically using some landmark detector we try to detect the landmarks where patrick's implementation supports 68 ones I personally prefer the ibug one. Using the landmark file we try to estiamte the camera parameters and try to minimize the error between the 2D landmarks and the projected 3D landmarks usually we come across this technique in Sfm technique and also other 3D reconstruciton pipeline because it is the heart of reconstruction. Using the camera parameters and the surrey's PCA model and the landmark points they to estiamte the shape parameters and project the image onto the 3D face. Patrick is still continuing his work by making the implementaion compatible with Basel Face Model & also trying to optimiza the parameters using Non linear implementations like Cerses Solver.\nThe sample output will look like this",

      "text": "Recently a lot research has been taking place in the region of combination of Computer Graphics & Computer Vision areas and the standards are being expected to raise after apple's introduction of Iphone X which have cutdown a lot of efforts in coverting the 2D-3D mapping using its front camera which seems to project a huge number of IR rays to estimate the geometry of the human face but it is really hard for a normal person to afford such high costs so I myself being an Indian and want to make it available to the normal families to experience such high end technolgies which would build more passion towards learning have taken up this project as one of my most import project and am planning to work in parallel along with mathematical visualization of Machine Learning and its advancements. \n\n\n\nI would like to keep this as a log which will help me remember the flow of work which I have planned to implement this work. It has really taken a lot of time since I am all by myself if having any advisor would have made work a bit more easier since with their experience I probably would have been directed to this point, Since I first became aware of this 3D Face Reconstruction technology based on the works of Prof.Ira Kemelmacher - UW CSE, I was first trying to understand the Shape from Shading, Structure from Motion techniques since I being from an EE background never had a chance to take up an Computer Graphics course even though I had taken up Computer Vision course in my final semester I wasn't much interested at that point of time since my drive was always towards the mathematical concepts that have been entangled either be it Machine Learning / Computer Vision / Medical Imaging or anything i was just addicted to the understanding of concepts on my own since I felt I would lose the kick/joy which I would gain during learning it after reading pages after pages sadly I was into that buble I kept reading papers after papers even till today I am doing the same but I realisez it is the time to take some action instead of aiming for one big ball, I should first pick up the lego pieces and try to join once after the other. Sorry I have gone completely out of the topic coming back, Every time I try to think about this problem how to make the 2D-3D interaction in a way with lesser complexity and higher accessibility always diffrent combinations of pipelines pop up in my mind instead I have decided I should implement one at first then it would make me clear during the implementation process how to permute the blocks in the pipeleine.",

      "text": "Review of Journal of Economics Paper by Omer Tamuz's Group\n\nIn brief this paper tries to focus on the convergance rate and its dependencies on actions and signals. They try to prove that the convergence occurs quickly with respect signals external observations rather than actions using a two state stochastic process. Taking the case of Gaussian distribution as the signal distribution they prove that the convergence with respect to actions occurs by \\(\\sqrt{\\log t}\\) times faster. They also discuss the definitivity of the convergence. \nThey were also emphasizing on the sublinerity of the actions influence. Sublinearity means \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{x_n}{n}\\).",

Press 'CTRL+Alt+F1' you will enter shell now enter your username and password credentials and then continue\nsudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n\n\nNow add the following lines in the end of the file ( Save & Exit)\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\noptions nouveau modeset=0\nalias nouveau off\nalias lbm-nouveau off\n\n\n\nNow get back to terminal and enter the following and later update the kernel and reboot\necho options nouveau modeset=0 | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau-kms.conf\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nsudo reboot\n\n\n\n\nIntel+Nvidia GPU working setup using bumblebee and primus\n\nBasically using primus we can switch between the graphics and we take the help of bumblebee to make it smooth and we also take the help of a GUI indicator to make the transistions more simple.\nAdd the following repositories\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:graphics-drivers\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:bumblebee/testing\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n\nGo to Settings >> Software & Updates >> Additional Drivers\nSelect Nvidia-378 driver (because it is stable and it worked for me) and click on Apply and then Restart the system.\nAfter Restarting you can see the Nvidia-driver being selected as the display driver which previously was Xorg's nouveau.For further conforamtion you can check with the following command and the output will be comething like this.\nnvidia-smi\n\n[root@localhost release]# nvidia-smi\nWed Sep 26 23:16:16 2012       \n+------------------------------------------------------+                       \n| NVIDIA-SMI 3.295.41   Driver Version: 295.41         |                       \n|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| Nb.

In my case I have downloaded cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run file because previous ones need a below 4.9 gcc compiler but when it comes to 16.04 by defualt it installs gcc-5.0 and the installation of Caffe requires a gcc-5 compiler to work ( portbuf). After downloading go to the specific folder and then\nchmod 755 cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run\nsudo ./cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run\n\n\n\nEnter no when asked to install Nvidia driver and rest all can be entered as Yes.\nDon't worry if it shows something like this\n===========\n\n= Summary =\n\n===========\n\nDriver: Not Selected\n\nToolkit: Installed in /usr/local/cuda-8.0\n\nSamples: Installed in /home/username, but missing recommended libraries\n\nPlease make sure that\n\n- PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin\n\n- LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64, or, add /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64 to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig as root\n\nTo uninstall the CUDA Toolkit, run the uninstall script in /usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin\n\nPlease see CUDA_Installation_Guide_Linux.pdf in /usr/local/cuda-8.0/doc/pdf for detailed information on setting up CUDA.\n\n***WARNING: Incomplete installation!

I want to thank God for letting me going through this which is making me stronger. I did lose my balance in life and Yes it did cost me time but by sacrificing nothing we cant gain anything. I learned not to expect anything in life. I did put myself into a box of belief and packed it with morals, I lost my sense of thinking by sticking my thoughts to sadness. I don't know why I was doing but I don't want to be tangled with anyone. I don't know what was I expecting by locking myself into the box. I learned that I would love to be in pain with sense rather than hapiness without sense. I did learn that I don't like to be happy but it doesn't make me sad I learned to enjoy the pain. Now I would rather prefer pain over happiness because it gives me a chance to learn and think and discover more about my trueself. I want to lead a life which can bring a smile in one's face. I realized going through struggles will bring the best person out of us. I did see my best and I am taking some affirmations which I will abide by and discover even more better version of me. I have no contact with anyone other than my family in this world. I might be poor interms of money but I am rich in love of my family for me, I want to be responsible for my family I want to take care of all of them. I want to make education free and equal to all I did observe that most of intelligence is not due to the prior its the training that makes them and I want to make the training to be equal for all and everyone has a right to learn as much as they can and money should not hinder it, I did realize that smile is not a part of my life and I just want to enjoy unwinding the equations which will give me a good satisfaction and make money for my parents and sister to help them in leading a happy life, I will give all I can in process of reaching my goals.I am happy to be a sad guy and Thank you God for this wonderful life!",
