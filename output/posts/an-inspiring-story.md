> A Story which I cam across in Quora. This gave me strength

I 'd like to stay anonymous, for reasons best kept in my heart. I was from a lower middle class family in Mumbai, born to parents who married in their mid 30’s, lost two children of tender age and I was the third. Needless to say I was brought up with a lot of care and my parents saw to it that I never faced any kind of hardship, no teasing, no bullying by other kids(I was weak as a child) and good teachings. While in my high school days my father retired and I though it was a shame on myself to continue with studies, I started to work while trying to continue my education through correspondence courses in universities. It had been around a couple of years my mother was growing weak day by day she was suffering from diabetes and regularly depended on tablets for sugar control but her condition remained a bit puzzling for my father . My father's savings and my meagre salary were not enough to take her to a specialist care. One more year passed by and during that time we decided to get her an eye cataract operation done, when during the mandatory health checkups doctors advised us to take her to Tata Memorial hospital, she was diagnosed with leukemia. At that time neither me nor my father knew anything about leukemia.

The trips to the hospital were horrible, the hospital was mostly over crowded and doctors stressed ( there is shortage of oncology doctors) , many a times after returning home late in the evening I used to cook food for my father and me which I learnt from my mother, she used to dictate me while lying on the bed, my father also suffered from diabetes and was severely stressed. My mother survived for 6 months after diagnosis and one early morning passed away, I saw my father completely collapsed and devastated at the moment, it was at our home. I informed our neighbours and called our relatives( who never arrived). I until that moment had seen how days can be cruel, for a guy who had an average happy life until my mother fell ill, but at that moment I was not crying because I had to care for my father and I did not cry until the last rites of my mother, I cried silently at night when I turned off the lights in the house. I pressed the grief in my heart and promised myself to never let it get away, I just never wanted my father to see how scared I was and how broke I was. After that day I put up a strong face, even though my mind was completely broke…..I know wounds to the heart heal with time, I never went to see any relative for help during that period, it was mostly just me and my father.

A couple of years later I joined in a government job and my father passed away.

Why do I write this here? Because this incident changed me completely, from a happy go lucky guy to a guy with a plan, I promised myself I will never let destiny catch me without my pants, I will never let unexpected things break me. I fell real hard into a hopeless situation but thankfully I got up….I am married now ( I married on my own, from making arrangements for marriage, I did everything, just like the last rights of my mother and father and with the blessings of kind hearted friends and strangers) I have a lovely wife and a kid now and I pray to God and plan for a good future for all of us.
