<p>I was always a playful guy who loved to watch cartoons and who likes to see people smile, Sorry even today I am the same but not as playful I used to be. I was very much infulenced by this character named  <code>Luffy</code> in my real life. He loves to explore the world, PS: exploration doesn't mean to just visit countries. He is kind at heart and fearless and always seeks freedom. The important thing is he lives his life to do something which he loved to do always and also never regrets. He never betrays. I just find myself very similar to this guy interms of characteristics. I want to explore the world and make sure everyone in world should get basic resources for free because in the end it's always an exploitation in this world in the end the poor doesn't get to do anything about making his situation better. I know it's something which is like impossible this is what excites me very much and the characteristic which I admire in <code>Luffy</code> too, he never cares even after many people telling him that it's nothing which can be pursed (Becoming a Pirate King). I want to utilise the tools which I feel as mystrength in-order to not let the dream to be left as dream forever. I have confidence on my <code>Will-Power</code> , <code>Love for Mathematics</code>. I want to use these tools to make a pavement fro this dream. I don't know if I should end up being an entreprenuer or a scientist or an engineer to achieve this. I just want to strive to make this happen.
<!-- TEASER_END --></p>
<p>It was a brief introduction to my life's aspirations and some of my admirations. I have had this another phase going my life which was something which I never thought of. I got close to <code>Box</code> during my work and I had people taking care of me many times in my life but she being very simple is what something attracted me a lot and knowing that she was able to overcome her past able to live her life also made me admire her. I came to know to she had a really bad past which always made me feel very bad overcoming my admiration to her the feeeling that in her past she was not able to stay along with the person she loved made me feel always bad. I am very genuine when it comes to love. I never ever enter into a joint circle of life becuase it really sinful and I never really thought entering into a relation because I always was happy living in my own world but since I got very close to person it just happend automatically. I really don't know should I have to call it as love or something but it always remains as a mystery for me.I did express one day myfeeling towards her. I wasn't actually clear but I did admire her , genuinely I would have never told to her but somehow in our discussion has turned out that way and I was supposed to answer( I wasn't aware of this story of her by the time I told her). She did express her thoughts genuinely and I did respect her thoughts too because even I don't why did I tell her, i should call it more like a texting pressure.I don't know sometiumes I feels if it happend for good or bad becuase I don't really wouldn't have taken these thing to heart if I wouldn't have expressed. Our discussions anyways didn't end.I used to do a lot of thinking in myself. I thought the songs she was sharing to me were having some inner meanings which she is trying to convey to me. Hahaha I was daffar kid. i am this cinematic guy right. This thought process of mine that someone is doing something to impress you was what I realized very lately now is not at all true. I don't know why did I cry when I came to know that I was trying to enter into a joint circle because the fact that their love was broken due to their family circumstances which always will make me respect them. I was acting like a kid I used to cry that if she is still remembering him and I don't want to enter into a realtion because it is really very painful for me. I cannot live with such emotional pain that I have pushed myself into this. She told me no but I don't know sometimes she used to convey that she won't think of him and shouldn't worry about him. I really didn't know how to take those words because she was telling that she never had feelings towards me but some acts used to make feel that there is something which she likes in me. See I was such a kid I always keep dreaming and this over positive view of life has sunk me deep into sea. I was literally building kingdoms within dreams even after getting rejected. (I still don't know did I express my feelings I really don't if it something love or not but even till today she is one of the persons whom I admire the most. I really don't have a plan of marriage with anyone else becuase I was happy enough and I am this crazy guy who keeps dreaming a lot and I don't want to mess someone else's life becuase when I love a person I really love to the brim. It definitely overflows). So I donno I was in this pseudo love with her. I felt she was also somewhat immature just like me because she never realized it was going to harm me a lot in future becuase I used to keep aside my things and wait for her to talk or every minute I used to think of her. I used to make her sleep every night during my work and then only I would sleep. Hahaha yeah you should be the one taking care of your life daffar no one will have so much time to care about you. I used to be very good at work in the initial days but after getting closer to <code>Box</code> I stopped working I used to literally go to office for her. Hahah this is really being a dumb ass part of my life. I don't know I was literally till the brim. But simultaneously I never lost my love for <code>Mathematics</code>. Yeah finally she did leave the office for studying management. I should be thankful to her because if it was not this all mess I wouldn't have gathered a courage to leave the company on my own. I am really thankful to her because I did leave my job for her because (asually shittiest thought process of my life I thought she always admired success that is what I literally living up my life for her.) So after a lot of drama I did leve the company but during my stay at company we used to share chocolates a lot and I lots of sweet things I always try to find something so that I can go and sit beside her. Hahhaa I know I am literal daffar. </p>
<p>I have reached my home and she also had left for her management studies. During this journey her mother got sick with dengue. I always like the elder ones and younger ones more realtively compared to +/- 10 of my age. I was really mad because I literally was thinking that she was my mother tooo.. See one way it's good (I have this good mentality which even I like about myself) but it's good to literally see as a family in the other way. I tried to make sure that <code>Box</code> doesn't get affected because of her mother's illhealth. I am really good at some times. Her mother has rocevered and both of us were happy. Literally my heart was throbbing because she told me about her mother that she did press <code>Box's</code> feet during her sleep thinking that <code>box</code> was tired after a long walk, it literally made me feel so great about her mother I started calling her <code>Amma</code> since that day. Yeah I did as responsibilty to make sure that she gets settled there in the campus properly and avoid home-sickness as much possible. I used to bug her all the time and find out how she was doing. I sometimes feel very bad because I had never done these things even to my sister. See this is what you do when you literally lose yourself. I used to call her everyday in the afternoon. I was just lost in some different world. I did act sometimes like a mad guy she used to bring up some unknown names frequently which I was not much interested in. Because when I share time and space with someone I just like to have only two of us travelling in it <code>See this is what I call madness</code>. I literally didn't know how to react when I had to face some positive comments about someone else. I am not an egoistic person but it got too much frequent I didn't know how to convey to her since I was literally spending all of my time waiting for these beautiful moments and when I find someone else also travelling in our <code>Time-Space</code> Mehhh! I didn't like it much. I somehow conveyed to her. I made an impression that I was being posessive I don't know she accepts that I love her and She sometimes feels happy but always keep reminding myself that she doesn't love me because I like to trust words more than the feeling because soemtimes when you have the strength to speak out firmly tells how much you are willing to commit. So I always thought and will be thinking untill someone tells me in words that they love me because feeling are too dangerous. We might get lost in those things and never know that how much someone might get affected becuase the most important thing is time and they are read to share it with you. Coming back now this was continued by comparing me someguy at her campus which she had just joined and coining that she wants to for a walk along with him for which was asking me if that would misunderstand things like I did about her. Since she was feeling alone there see she was not a bad girl she was just seeking some company there so it will make her feel good. By the way she was always there whenever I used to travel to home everynight she used to stay awake and talk to me in phone till midnight those were sometimes I feel there is someone who likes my company sometimes. Haha coming back I was broken then not for that she was going for a walk with someone but she did misunderstand me for someone who she had just met a day ago. I was really broken. Yeah but I never scold anyone becuase I feel I never have a right to hurt someone with words and why should I scold. I told her that yeah she shouldn't miss any friends because it's her life and she should be making the decisions in her life and should not hand it over to someone else in her life I feel sometimes this is something which I made her realize and I really wanted her to realize because she used to rely on her friends in making a decision always once it happend to me also she had approached her friend if she had to talk to me or not. I feel bad that I made her cry that day. I really didn't want her to cry but I did because it really important in life you should take help of riends but not always depend on friends for making serious decisions in your life becauyse we never know who might be in which sitaution and their situation should not affect your life. COming back to the similar guy like me when she told me that she doesn't want him to misunderstand, I know she is a nice girl but I was pretty hard on her I told that I don't want to talk to her anymore. I did create a very bad times for a period of 2 weeks I guess and it was something which I regret sometimes becuase she aws going to have her Internship interviews and she needs some emotional strength and I know how it feels when you always have someone behindyour back that nothing to worry just give your best. I regret that I wasn't there for herin right time but sometimes I really used to feel why was doing all this when it was even clear that things are not at all gong to work between both because I was using phone a lot infront of my father which makes me feel very awkard sometimes becuase me and him are really good pals we never hide things between us atleast I don't. I believe eeven he doesn't. I wan't also studying much and waiting for the time when she would be returing to room so that we can talk. <code>See this is called literally forgetting that you were born like 22 years ago (21 actually) by that time</code>. I didn't like what I am doing becuase I don't like to have awkaward situations between me and my father. I was by then slowly getting aware of somethings very unusual in my family which I had sensed one year agao but I did try to supress it my own ways but I got to know that it didn't work. I admire my father really a lot but I don't know if it's my excessive useless analytical skills or anything else I really did sense something very unusual and I really cant express this to my sister because inspite of her matured thinking I didn't feel like sharing this to anyone but i could sense that my mother was also in pain and my father too was also some what being uncomfortable. Okay so I had and still have something to take care in my family so I did ask her one day okay we arre talking to each other a lot but what is it going up to in the end. I could see she wasn't ready and even I wasn't but I believed that I can make anything possible ( I really don't know if it is my strength or weakness till date but I really find it as a strength.) See I had thing which I made clear myself that I want everything in words because feeling are too dangerous for me and I was made clear and even i would told the same words becuyase who can decide just based on our interaction for few months. I just want to move on either this side or that side because I had too or else I felt that I am going to be doomed. So one day I did tell her that we should not be talking anymore I knnow it was going to be the extremest decision I have ever made because I never wanted to stop talking to someone ever in my life. I really don't know because sometimes I feel she is self sufficient she doesn't need anyone in her life. I was never expecting anything from her but somtimes I don't know I was very close to her right so one day I got my leg fractured and the same she had giuven her exam very well. i didn't tell her that thing untill I get to know how she had given her exam after getting to know that she did her exam well I did tell her that my leg's fingure was fractured yeah she did ask about some wehere abouts but I really felt that didn't matter to her much. It just occured to my mind why should I spend so much of my time with someone who doesn't care that much. I know it was really a bad thought but it was not like I was expecting something. I don't know it just occured to me and I couldn't find any positive alternative which I usually try to find when ever I sense something which I was doing is not right.</p>
<p>But I still had to do it because I spend most of my my time either waiting for her or talking to her and when you can sense that things are pretty clear won't feel like concentrating on the most important stuff which has to be dealt that's what even I thought on top of I was facing some issues in my family and it was the time I should take responsibilty to set things right. I was afraid and I just want to take care of my mother and I love my father too, and my sister who isn't interested in studying anymore she needs to work towards aiming for GATE. I have made some plans for myself and I can sense that it was my time to take some responsibility. My father knows that I like to drive myself so inorder to give me some drive he reminds me about his ill health which always try to recollect and makes me cautious.
Yes I didn't knew how to tell her that I can't wait for her till she would reply and I can't spare for time things like if she can go for a walk with someother guy or she telling me that some guy is sweet around there. I just told her if there is anything she feels that I can help please ask me help because I may not be able to talk like before. Yes I know it was hard on her and I also know how it was going to turn out. I was ready fro everything. Yes for first week I could sense the difference but I stubborn because I can't be there always for her despite having my own issues to deal with. Yes she did get her internship I was very much happy for that. I could sense she was angry on me and she was releived out of the interships thing. I asusually make an ultimate mess out of everything I dragged things so much that I could sense that it wasn't going to be same again. So that way here 2 semesters got over and I am at my home studying for Masters hopefully trying for a paper. But meanwhile something happend I did feel somewhere in the middle why can't I handle this I shouldn't have done that way. I messaged her I did apologize to her and some discussion happend in the end she did reply saying <code>No Choice! I am sorry</code> yeah those were the moments I felt okay why did I put myself into this situation. Why did I admire her so much. Why wasn't I being in control of emotions I was just dancing here and there like a mad frog. I just don't know I can't even name once situtation which I can actually tell myself that she has feeling for you but I don't why it doesn't draw the logics serious math but when it comes to love it make some random connections and give the expected result which Yes dammit! she has feelings for you LOL! This what it means to not have control on yuor emotions and feeling. but I with sense really did admire her. I call it admiration because I really don't know what love means when it comes to othere than my family because for me family is entirely diffrent from friends yes I don't know she doesn't want me to waste her like but I don't know sometimes she tries to remind me that you are loving me dammit continue. She tells me that she likes my blue shirt which I have saved it still by not wearing it because I am afraid it might lose it's colour.See you can see here my colours I only myself imagine that if she likes my shirt that implies she loves me, haha crazy daffar I am I just make up things for myself and cry Hahaha see sometimes I can make you feel that I am goddamn lover :p. In this semester she had messaged me it seems ragrding hello kitty , she wanted to know why did I gift her see I just don't if it's my imagination or something I just don't want to assume things again because it is goddamn painful.there was time i even thought of dying for a second but my parents flash always right in time becuase I know I can never let anyone exceed my parents because they are the most important people in my life and it's because of them I able to enjoy all this freedom and I also tried to tell this clearly. She changes her status whenever we talk in whatsapp. See here comes again my  uglky side I assume that she changes them for me this is something which has driven me all the wrong roads. I just don't want to assume things. I know that I made her feel that I am watching her posts in quora anymore but she doesn't know that I still do watch her posts to know her mood I don't why but it really interestes me see here also I try to play the correaltion game and cheat myself. I don't wan to do it anymore. I really want to stay away from all the social networking sites. I have drawn a lot of inspiration from many bloggers and Daniel Seista he really inspired me inspite of being deaf he did manage to listen all the lecture and is about succesfully complete his PHD in coming years. See he really writes a wonderful blog. I could sense his interst in reinforcement learning in-order to make medical instrumentation easier and help the other disable live their dreams. I really love these people. Yes I was badly hurt I know the reason too because it was me who had started this. I realized the problem was myself I put myself into her shell and I imagine things and I dissapoint when they won't happen and sometimes the shells also gives some space fro me to fit in may be it's because of it's kindness or never saying no attitude. Slowly slowly I can see that she has lost my memories because she doesn't remember about the book I had given her. I am not sad about it because she was true she never loved me. it was myself who had drawn all the crazy lines and tried to walk on them. But anyways after seeing so many stories and tachings I really did understand what actually life is meant for and the answer for why do we live?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So finally after my deep analysis how should I live my life ?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Life is really simple if you try to keep it simple. If you make a mess then it will always be a mess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think this way, What is the diffrence between you and a wild animal when you are not able to have control on your thought process or emotions. Are you a mad dog who bites when it gets mad? No right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be aware of what you are doing whatevere the situation mey be. Just be aware you should be clearly able to answer yourself and justify why you are doing this particular task at this point of time is the reason a valid one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never ever expect things in life. We are here to explore things not to expect things to happen and When you take Lord Rama's or Shiva's story you can see even they had to face a lot of struggles in their life and everything is a part of life. Just be patient and keep doing your work a day will come when everything will be fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't curse yourself, You might have planned something to do in a particular schedule but you were unable to finish, be calm and talk to yourself and find out what was reason behind the delay in task completion was your planning no proper or implemenatation wasn't proper correct yourself. Be positive. Just love everything around your appreciate everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember we are here to explore things we see things from others we feel like doing like them it's okay to explore in their manner but there should be something specific to yourself right. Yes focus on it don't compare yourself with someone far higher than you and get demotivated. Your life's purpoise is to explore.But whatever you are doing our only thing is to do it hearlfully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have this problem of opening youtube and watching videos I just wanted to analyse why do I spend so much time on youtube I just gave a thought and I understood that it's my mood whenever I remind of <code>Box</code> oir when I get demotivate I try to find something which can give me happiness. See there is a difference if you earn happiness the feeling will be wonderful and if you are being happy watching happy is it something which you are earning. You will be happy when you create something new that happiness is really cool to experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So finally the whole purpose of this post was to make myself clear about my thought process and intensions. I think I should give 1005 to my schedule and I am going to stop watching quora and facebook because it something I am satisfying myself by analysing her activity in quora and predicting her moods. See it's not right you should not do such things.  Whta do achieve in analysing her mood based on the posts she upvotes rather focus on some intersting problems and apply your logic there. She is also being bvery happy and having good friends who are unlike me hahaha traeting her friendship as love.. <code>Lol! this daffar in me is going to die.. Bachaooo.. No more stalking version of me .. No more dreaming version of me. When it's meant to be happen it will happen just don't worry too much and this world has a lot of beauty to explore.</code> I here by declare that I am acceptling that I am giving up on her and I would be always happy if she likes me and would also be happy if she finds some who is not as annoying as me and someone who can match her expectations in everything afterall the mess i had made she always has a kind heart to talk to me normally. I am thankful to god for giving me this lesson and wonderful opprtuninty to explore the true meaning of living.I just want to move on to something else which is more crucial for me at this point of my life. I want to take care of my mother she always inspires me and no matter early morning the work she does before and after the school, I really the dedication she has toward making our lives better. I will be in ever debt to my parents.I really want to make this world a better place I will try to be aware all the time and make my dreams come true. I will try to make education as a basic need to everyone and which need anything to charge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for giving me this wonderful life. I just want to really make the best out of it and I really want to help and get inspired by people like Daniel Seista, My Mother, My Father. I also want to thank <code>Box</code> for giving me wonderful opportunity to explore my life and heloing me to be clear about what I have to do with my life when it becomes a mess. Everything in this world happens for a reason True dat!</p>
