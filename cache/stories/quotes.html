<li>Initially I used to run inorder to develop my stamina and lose weight so that I won't feel much lazy but later I realized since I am spending an hour daily in this why can't I make this also a part of exploration I want to raise my bar. Previously I used to run about 8-9 rounds slowly I should say it is somewhat like jogging, but recently I want to give my best in everything I do since I am dedicating 1 hour daily why can't I progress in this. I decided to increase my speed and reduce the distance to 5 rounds. I started initially it used to take me like 12min:28sec some where around that point slowly in five four days I could pick up my speed to 11min:48sec. Yes it really feels great because you know your pace and I never used to understand why is it so hard to increase ones speed by 30s afterall why cant they give their 100% here comes the catch, The essential part of raising your speed is not physical it is in the proportion of 90 mental and 10 physical. Yes you need to focus on the foot steps train to maintain your pace and simultaneously conserve your energy till the end since it is a marathon kind of thing your just can't make a sprint. If you focus on some thoughts during running which I used to do before and that was actually why I used to run so that I can think quite well but later I understood everything is just the same when you try to focus on the physics of running like controlling your pace just like a feedback control system sending realtime signal feedback to your mind and giving back the necessary action in order to maintain the speed constant. Slowly I got the trick of runnig I made it to 10min:48sec I was on cloud8 and I could really sense its all about control just dont give a chance to think about anything else just your goal should keep on projecting every second in your brain. Today is the day literally I was just thinking about 5 rounds &amp; 5 rounds &amp; 5 rounds .. all the time. When I get to think about either Dabba or someone no no my brain just flashes light its 5 rounds you bugger just runnnn. So today I made it to 10min:02sec. I just want to reflect the same thing in my work too everything is the same just remember your karma. Evrything else follows. Thank You its a great day overall. Something to laugh I am sensing a growth in height which is really awkward actually at the age of 22. </li>
