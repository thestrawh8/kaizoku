<h3>Richard Feynman</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enjoying the work you do you don't have to bound your views of a concept based on the constrains of others, be fresh and pure.</li>

<p>These are the three shades which I have. I would like to balance these states of mine which are different and all together build me up. I will be Aware, Pure, Fresh (Mingyur Rinpoche) &amp; will be contain simultaneously the No fear, No distractions (Tyler Durden) &amp; will also contain the freshness,clarity, excitement, enthusiasm towards learning &amp; mastering science(Richard Feynman). </p>
