* Shiva is often shown with many faces, as creator, destroyer and preserver in total command of the cosmos.
* He contains both good and evil. He is moody, free of inhibitions, easy to please, protector of the down trodden, and has the power to alter the laws of destiny
* Lord Shiva is known as the God of mercy and kindness. He protects his devotees from all evil that are always around us.
* Blue-necked (having consumed poison to save the world from destruction)

> Shiva's Trishul

Trishul represents the three aspects of consciousness – waking, dreaming and sleeping, and it represents the three gunas – satva, rajas and tamas. Holding a trishul (Trident) signifies that Shiva (the divinity) is above all the three states – waking, dreaming and sleeping, yet is the upholder of these three states.

> Shiva's third eye

Shiva’s third eye represents the rejection of desire. It is the eye that killed Kama. And why does Shiva reject desire? Because he realized the consequences of desire – when the object of desire (Sati) goes away, there is immense sorrow and rage. Desire not only evokes positive emotions (love, affection, contentment, compassion), it also evokes negative emotions (anger, dissatisfaction, sorrow). Shiva therefore shies away from it, preferring the cold still mountains which represent the state of transcendence – where there is just stillness, silence and bliss.
